//Arrays

let myArr: any[] = ["Football", "Cricket", 1, true ]; // Array with elements of any data type
myArr = [ 300, 400 ]; //will work

let myArr1: number[] = [10, 20, 30]; // array of numbers
//Another way is 
let list: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];  //array of numbers

// Check the following example
let myArr2: [number, string] = [123, "ABC"];
//myArr2 = ["ABC", 123]; // will throw an error as the array element should match the data type specified.
// This is Tuple. Tuple is a data structure consisting of multiple parts.
